# RefLab

RefLab is a professional learning and training platform for football referees, focused on improving decision-making, rule knowledge, and match performance.

This repository contains the **RefLab MVP**, built by a small team with a strong focus on learning, clean architecture, and long-term scalability.

---

## 🎯 Project Scope (MVP)

The MVP focuses on **one core learning loop**:

**Tests → Feedback → Dashboard insights**

Included in the MVP:
- Authentication (email/password + Google)
- Learning modules (Tests as the primary feature)
- Dashboard with progress, strengths & weaknesses
- Chatbot (basic)
- Notifications (basic)
- Profile & settings
- Feedback / issue reporting
- Legal pages (TOS, Privacy, Cookies)

Out of scope for MVP (planned later):
- Advanced leaderboards & leagues
- Advanced AI coaching
- Community / social features
- Deep analytics & reporting

- Tailwind CSS
- Vite

### Backend
- Supabase (Auth, Database, Storage)
- Edge Functions (later, if needed)

### Tooling
- ESLint
- Docker (local infra, optional)
- Git + GitHub

## 🚀 Getting Started (Frontend)

### Requirements
- Node.js ≥ 18
- npm

### Setup
```bash
cd apps/frontend
npm install
````

### Environment variables

Create a `.env.local` file in `apps/frontend`:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
```

### Run the app

```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🧭 Development Guidelines

### UI vs Feature logic

* Reusable UI components → `components/ui`
* Page / feature-specific logic → `features/<feature>/components`

**Rule:**

> UI components render. Feature components decide behavior.

### Feature folders

Each feature owns its:

* UI composition
* API calls
* Types

Avoid cross-feature coupling.

## 🤖 AI Usage Guidelines

AI is used to assist development, but:

* Prompts must be explicit and precise
* Generated code must be reviewed
* Architecture rules must be respected
* No direct Supabase calls inside UI components

---

## 🛠 Current Project Phase

* Phase 1: Foundation ✅
* Phase 2: Authentication 🚧
* Phase 3: Tests learning loop ⏳

---

## 🔀 Contribution Workflow

* Work on feature branches
* Keep commits small and descriptive
* Do not commit `.env` files
* When unsure, ask before refactoring structure
